# Customer Retension 

Here is the background information on your task
A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management,
the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your 
work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retentio
n Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
The Retentions Manager has provided some information in the resources.

Here is your task
    Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to do the following tasks:
    Define proper KPIs
    Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
    Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed
